## Serverless architecutre on AWS

N-tier architecture components - network, database, MVC application, REST endpoints, application/web servers

- Utilize VPC, OpsWorks (AWS version of Chef), Cloudformation (AWS IaaS automation scripting), EC2, RDS/DynamoDB, S3, API Gateway, AWS Lambda and Route 53 to create equivalent N-Tier architecture.
- For serverless apps,the architecture is hence translated as :

<ol>
<li> DynamoDB for data </li>
<li> AWS Lambda to act as DAO </li>
<li> API Gateway to act as integration layer exposing the endpoints for invoking the lambda </li>
<li> S3 acts as the presentation layer, and also doubles up as static webstite hosting and providing object storage </li>
<li> Secure the architecture using VPC by restricting access to the provisioned infrastructure along with WAF and SSL </li>
<li> Route 53 can be used to provision a DNS for the app </li>
</li>


### Demo - Backend DynamoDB

- Create a simple table in DynamoDB and create a table. Minimum details.

Table Name : Books
Primary Key : bookId
Columns : bookId, author, bookName

Once table is created, go to Items tab and create a table.

### Demo - DAO - AWS Lambda

- Use a simple template with Node.js backend and create a function named "Book Details"
- Use the dynamoDB Client to query the books table, add callback and log errors to console.

### Demo - Integration Layer - API Gateway

- Create a GET Endpoint invoking the existing lambda function (the "Book Details" function created in previous step). Use the same region as Lambda.
- In the body mapping template, specifiy Content-Type = 'application/json'
- Mention method body as "Passthrough" so everything from the request including header, query params and body is available to the lambda.
- Test and verify the API gateway can invoke the lambda and return a HTTP 200.
- Actions -> Deploy -> Deployment -> Stage, and give a description. Create a new environment where we want to promote this endpoint.
- You can invoke this API from the endpoint where the API Gateway is deployed.
- Use the SDK -> Generate Client -> Javascript option to generate a REST client. This can be used to invoke the app from S3.

### Demo - Presentation Layer - S3

- Create a simple HTML form to query the Books table by bookId. Upload this HTML, the generated SDK client for api gateway and generated lib directory
to a new S3 bucket. Name should be globally unique and if exposed on Route 53, should match the DNS hostname.
- Set CORS on the API Gateway. Make resources public access, so it can be accessed as a static site. Redeploy the gateway.
- Form can be invoked using the autogenerated endpoint provided for the S3 static site hosting.
- When then the form submit the SDK client invokes the lambda and returns the value of data from Book Details DynamoDB collection.

### Demo - Assign Domain - Route 53

- Pre-requisites : A working domain name pre-configured in Route 53 with NS, SOA and A records.
- Create a new Alias record set with following details :
```
Name : books.abc.com
Type : A - IPV4 Address
Alias Target : The S3 bucket endpoint
```
- Now try to invoke using domain name from your browser. It should redirect to the static site set up in S3.
- Hence we are able to create a MVC serverless app with a UI, DAO, database, and REST endpoint.

### Security Considerations

#### API Gateway Security Considerations :
- Design API properly and protect them using IAM policies.
- Secure your public facing API with API Keys (Least recommended, know the risks and use them properly).
- Allow CORS only for recognized domains.
- The correct way to secure API Gateways is by using custom authorizers (SAML, OAuth, Custom Tokens).
- protect your backend by using and validating client SSL Certificates.
